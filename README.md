# Restaurant Page


## Abstract
Restaurant menu page created for The Odin Project curriculum. 

Per assignment instructions, all content on the entire site was created in Javascript and appended to a blank HTML boilerplate. 

This was my first project using **Webpack**. While building this site, a lot of my time was spent learning how to configure webpack correctly, reading the documentation, and learning the syntax for the config files.

Utilizing **imports** and **exports** for the first time was a nice step up from the *Revealing Module Pattern* that I used in my previous project: [book-library](https://github.com/WitchingHr/book-library).

Additionally, I was able to get more practice in with organizing data using an array of objects for the restaurant menu, and then retrieving the data when it came time to populate it to the DOM. 

Lastly, I experimented with the *Inline Frame Element* and threw in a Google Maps section on my Restaurant Address page like this one:
<div align="center">
